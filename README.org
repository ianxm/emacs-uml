* overview

  [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] is a text editor.  an extensible one.  it is mainly used for
  coding, but it can also do anything else.  uml is a modeling
  language for creating diagrams of software design.

  uml.el is a minor mode for emacs that makes it easier to build ascii
  sequence diagrams in emacs.  it's goal is to do for sequence
  diagrams what orgtbl-mode does for tables.

* example
  
uml.el can convert this content:

   person1     person2     kitchen
      |- make me a sandwich  |           |
      | no way   - -|           |
      |--sudo make me a sandwich                     |           |
      |          |-do it           |
      |          |          - -|
      |  sandwich - -|           |

into this:

   person1                    person2     kitchen
      |                          |           |
      |   make me a sandwich     |           |
      |------------------------->|           |
      |                          |           |
      |         no way           |           |
      |< - - - - - - - - - - - - |           |
      |                          |           |
      | sudo make me a sandwich  |           |
      |------------------------->|           |
      |                          |           |
      |                          |   do it   |
      |                          |---------->|
      |                          |           |
      |                          |< - - - - -|
      |                          |           |
      |        sandwich          |           |
      |< - - - - - - - - - - - - |           |
      |                          |           |

* features

  right now uml.el only supports sequence diagrams.  it may be
  extended for class diagrams one day.

  uml.el provides key bindings for more easily moving around sequence
  diagrams, and aligning and redrawing them.

  diagrams can be embedded in source code comments.

* setup

  1. install emacs
  2. get [[https://raw.github.com/ianxm/emacs-uml/master/uml.el][uml.el]], add it to your emacs installation
  3. run "M-x uml-mode"
  4. move the point onto a graph and hit "C-c C-c"

* usage

** a list of names will be spread out and centered over timelines

*** before

person1 person2 kitchen

*** after

   person1     person2     kitchen
      |           |           |

** a dash next to a timeline will create an arrow to its neighbor

*** before

   person1     person2     kitchen
      |-           |           |

*** after

   person1     person2     kitchen
      |           |           |
      |---------->|           |
      |           |           |


* todo

  - multi-line timeline titles
  - separators
  - self messages
  - class diagrams
